### Howdy!

## I'm Steven,

- I work in manufacturing engineering, currently for a major supplier of trackwork for railroads 
- I've programmed CNC machines, robots, PLCs, and am currently developing software that automates G code generation
- I love design and fabrication, but the more I program the more I become obsessed
- I have a thing for things that function efficiently; doing a lot with a little is way cooler than being an op beefcake
- (*That said*, there is a time and place for **SPEED** and **POWER!**)
- Humility is critical, when you think you know it all, the universe has a knack for proving you wrong
- Learning every day is what keeps it interesting, new tools are always needed!
